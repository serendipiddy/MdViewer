A basic viewer of MarkDown documents for Android. The intention is to make this a dedicated viewer app and leave the editing to other apps.

Desired features
----------------
 * Use newer Material theme
 * Open files via intent/"open as" menu
 * Allow hyperlinks to function between documents with the same root directory and view images
 * File selector for file on file system, URL and Dropbox
